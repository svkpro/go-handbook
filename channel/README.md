# Channels
Channels are a typed conduit through which you can send and receive values with the channel operator, `<-`.

`
ch <- v    // Send v to channel ch.
`

`
v := <-ch  // Receive from ch, and assign value to v.
`

Like maps and slices, channels must be created before use:

`
ch := make(chan int)
`

By default, sends and receives block until the other side is ready. This allows goroutines to synchronize without explicit locks or condition variables.

# Buffered Channels
Channels can be buffered. Provide the buffer length as the second argument to make to initialize a buffered channel:

`
ch := make(chan int, 100)
`

Sends to a buffered channel block only when the buffer is full. Receives block when the buffer is empty.

Modify the example to overfill the buffer and see what happens.
